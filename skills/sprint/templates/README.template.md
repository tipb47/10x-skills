# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Ops — Sprint System

Sprint-directed build of {{ONE_LINE_MISSION}}.
<!-- init: state whether this folder is git-tracked, per interview. -->

## How to start a sprint (kickoff for a fresh agent session)

Run `/sprint direct` in a fresh session, or paste:

> You are the {{PROJECT_NAME}} sprint director. Read `{{OPS_PATH}}/STATE.md`, then
> `{{OPS_PATH}}/DIRECTOR_GUIDELINES.md`, then the sprint files STATE.md points to.
> Analyze the sprint requirements against current reality (repo, stores, background jobs).
> Ask all blocking, open, and clarifying questions. Present your execution plan for
> approval. Then run the sprint end to end.

**Contract rule:** `SPRINT.md` is the *what*; the director's plan is the *how*. If
analysis shows the sprint doc no longer matches reality, amend `SPRINT.md` and log the
deviation in `STATE.md` BEFORE spawning tracks.
