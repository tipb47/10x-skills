# Sprint System — methodology engine

This skill is the **engine** for a sprint-directed development methodology. Each project
keeps its own **instance**: an `ops/` folder holding its design contract, guidelines,
roadmap, sprint files, and a living state ledger. **The project's local ops/ docs are
always authoritative — wherever they conflict with this skill, the local docs win.** This
skill provides the boot rituals, the scaffolding templates, and the cross-project registry.

## The methodology in one paragraph

Work is divided into **sprints**: bounded milestones, each run end-to-end by ONE fresh
Claude Code session (the **director**) for context hygiene. The director never builds; it
analyzes, gates, spawns **track** subagents (each with a self-contained `TRACK-*.md`
prompt, each on its own git branch, parallel tracks in git worktrees), then audits their
diffs, verifies their claims against real state, resolves conflicts, merges in a defined
order, and closes by updating the ledger (`STATE.md`) and drafting the next sprint from
what actually happened. Humans appear at **operator gates** — explicit pauses for
deployments, account signups, approvals — never as mid-flight track interruptions.

## Subcommand routing

Parse the argument. No argument or unrecognized → print the usage summary below and stop.

```
/sprint init    — scaffold or adopt the sprint system in the current project
/sprint direct  — become the sprint director for this project's current sprint
/sprint status  — dashboard across all registered sprint projects
```

---

## /sprint init

Scaffold the sprint system into the current project, interview-driven. Never overwrite
existing files.

1. **Detect existing instance.** Look for an ops folder (`ops/`, `.docs/ops/`, or ask).
   If one exists → **adopt mode**: map its files against the canonical layout (below),
   report gaps (no STATE.md? no guidelines? missing sections?), offer to fill ONLY the
   gaps using the templates, then register (step 5) and stop. Never modify existing docs
   beyond explicitly approved gap-fills.
2. **Interview** (AskUserQuestion — adapt wording to what you can already see in the repo;
   skip questions the codebase answers). Interview discipline, here and in every later
   question round:
   - **Every question carries your recommended answer** as the first option, labeled
     `(Recommended)` — never present a bare option list you have no opinion on.
   - **Batch only independent questions.** If one question's answer determines whether or
     how another applies, sequence them — ask the upstream question first, then shape the
     downstream batch from its answer. Never make the user answer a question that a
     sibling answer in the same batch could invalidate.
   - Look up *facts* yourself (filesystem, git, configs); put only *decisions* to the user.

   The fixed topics:
   - Ops location and git tracking: `ops/` vs `.docs/ops/`; tracked or untracked? If
     tracked, ops bookkeeping (STATE.md/SPRINT.md churn) commits SEPARATELY from code under
     an `[sNN/ops]` tag; if untracked, the ops dir is gitignored. Either way the code
     history stays clean — encode the resulting rule into the generated guidelines.
   - Project surfaces: repos/packages/deploy targets a sprint touches; how deploys happen
     (manual command? CI?) — deploys are usually operator gates.
   - Team shape: solo, or other humans pushing out-of-band? (Out-of-band pushers need
     pull-and-check-recent-commits rules in the guidelines.)
   - Verification contract: what makes a track's work *provably* done — test suites,
     data-quality gates (row counts / verification queries with expected output), build
     artifacts, or a mix? This shapes the guidelines' "gates" section.
   - Database/migrations: does the project have a DB? If so: migrations are FILES tracks
     write and ONLY the director applies — confirm the apply mechanism (CLI, MCP, etc.).
   - Track model policy: which model tier for track subagents by default, and what class
     of work escalates to the strongest tier (contract/interface-defining work is the
     usual answer)?
   - Roadmap seed: the next 3–6 milestone-level goals, and which ONE becomes sprint-01.

   After the fixed questions, do a **grill pass** — proactive, not reactive: attack the
   sprint-01 plan's weakest assumptions even when nothing looks ambiguous. Probe what the
   user did NOT put on the table: failure modes ("what happens when the deploy/migration/
   external API fails mid-sprint?"), boundary cases, and contradictions between answers
   ("you chose X earlier, but this goal implies Z — which wins?"). 2–3 adversarial
   questions (AskUserQuestion, each with a recommended answer) aimed at whatever would
   most likely sink or reshape sprint-01.

   Then a **clarify pass**: if the roadmap seed or sprint-01 scope is still ambiguous,
   contradictory, or too thin for a self-contained track, ask focused follow-ups until
   sprint-01 can be written with zero placeholders. Never generate hollow docs over
   unresolved ambiguity.
3. **Generate** from `templates/` (this skill's folder), substituting interview answers
   for `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` and resolving every `<!-- init: ... -->` directive (these
   comments instruct YOU what to fill; they never survive into generated files):
   `README.md`, `STATE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `SPRINT_GUIDELINES.md`, `DIRECTOR_GUIDELINES.md`,
   `ROADMAP.md`, and `sprints/sprint-01/SPRINT.md` (+ one `TRACK-*.md` per sprint-01 track).
   Sprint-01 track files must be genuinely self-contained: a fresh subagent with no other
   context executes one end-to-end.
4. **Quality bar:** generated docs must contain zero TODOs and zero template placeholders.
   If an interview answer is "not sure yet", write the current best decision into the doc
   and log it as provisional in STATE.md's decisions table — docs ship decided, not hollow.
5. **Register** the project in the cross-project registry at `~/.claude/sprint/projects.json`
   (`{name, path, ops}`). Create the file (and its directory) if missing.
6. Print the kickoff instructions: the user starts a FRESH session and runs `/sprint direct`
   (or pastes the kickoff prompt from the generated README).

├── STATE.md                ← living ledger: current sprint, decisions, history, running jobs. READ FIRST.
├── DESIGN.md               ← canonical contract: architecture, schemas, conventions, standing decisions
├── SPRINT_GUIDELINES.md    ← rules for tracks + directors: gates, branch discipline, definition of done
├── DIRECTOR_GUIDELINES.md  ← director runbook: boot → analyze → gate → tracks → audit → merge → close

## /sprint direct

Become the sprint director for the current project's active sprint.

1. **Locate the instance:** current project in `~/.claude/sprint/projects.json`, else detect
   an ops folder, else tell the user to run `/sprint init`.
2. **Boot in this order:** `STATE.md` (current-sprint pointer, decisions, running jobs) →
   `DIRECTOR_GUIDELINES.md` → `SPRINT_GUIDELINES.md` + `DESIGN.md` → the current
   `sprints/sprint-NN/SPRINT.md` and its `TRACK-*.md` files.
3. **Analyze requirements vs reality** before anything else (the project's director
   guidelines define specifics; universal minimum): `git pull --ff-only` and compare repo
   state against the sprint doc's assumptions; verify claimed prior state against actual
   stores (DBs, buckets, artifacts); check any background-job manifests/status files
   STATE.md references — progressed, stalled, failed?; confirm credentials/tooling the
   sprint needs are alive. **If reality contradicts the sprint doc: amend SPRINT.md and
   log the deviation in STATE.md BEFORE spawning tracks.** Docs never drift from what runs.
4. **Clarify, reconcile, then plan:** raise ALL blocking/open/clarifying questions via
   AskUserQuestion (genuine operator decisions only — look up facts yourself). Follow the
   init interview discipline: every question leads with your `(Recommended)` answer, and
   dependent questions are sequenced, not batched with the questions they depend on. If answers
   shift scope, reconcile — amend SPRINT.md and log in STATE.md — then re-surface any new
   ambiguity, looping until the sprint is unambiguous. A track must never inherit a question
   you could have closed here. Present Gate 0 items. Then present your execution plan (plan
   mode where available): spawn order, parallelism, merge order, what you'll verify at
   audit. On approval, execute.
5. **Run the sprint** per the local DIRECTOR_GUIDELINES. Universal rules that always apply:
   - Directors direct: write code only for merge conflicts and trivial audit fixes.
   - One subagent per track; parallel same-repo tracks get `isolation: "worktree"`;
     independent tracks spawn in one message.
   - **Verify, never trust:** "pushed"/"loaded"/"done" are claims — check git/remote/DB/
     artifact state yourself before acting on them. Re-run tracks' verification gates
     yourself at audit.
   - Audit the FULL diff per track against DESIGN.md before merging; merge `--no-ff` in
     SPRINT.md's stated order; suites green on main after each merge.
   - Track branches are durable; if resuming a dead session, re-audit anything unmerged
     rather than trusting prior-session memory.
6. **Close:** operator close-gate as an actionable checklist; update STATE.md (shipped,
   deviations, learnings, background jobs); draft/amend the next sprint's files from what
   actually happened; final report with the next kickoff pointer.
   **Promotion path:** if a learning is project-agnostic (a git scar, an audit technique),
   propose promoting it into this skill's templates — keep the engine improving.

### Universal scars (hard-won; bake into every project's guidelines)

- With worktrees, ALWAYS `git -C <absolute-path>` — a bare git command in a stale cwd has
  reset a branch mid-merge.
- Parallel worktree tracks must NEVER `git stash` — `refs/stash` lives in the COMMON git
  dir and is shared across every worktree; two agents stashing concurrently swapped
  stacks and each popped the OTHER's work (recovered only via dangling stash commits).
  Baseline-testing in a worktree = scratch commit or file copy, never the stash. Put this
  prohibition in every parallel track brief.
- A context/auth/middleware change verified on one transport is UNVERIFIED on the deployed
  one: a second transport adapter (e.g. a serverless handler) with its own inline
  context-builder passed every unit test while the feature was dead in-cloud. Keep such
  logic in ONE transport-agnostic helper consumed by every adapter, pin the deployed
  transport with a test, and have the director probe the DEPLOYED path before closing the
  merge.
- Stage with EXPLICIT paths; never `git add -A`/`git add .` — bulk adds have swept local
  config into pushed commits.
- Never chain push/merge after a PIPED build/test in one compound command — the pipe masks
  the exit code. Verify, check exit code, THEN push. Judge builds by exit code, not stderr.
- A green suite can mask a silently-skipping subtree: compare skip COUNTS against the
  track's reported numbers, not just exit codes.
- Before trusting an e2e run, check what's actually listening on the port — zombie dev
  servers from dead agents produce phantom results.
- Check a misbehaving process's ACTUAL environment (`/proc/<pid>/environ`), not its `.env`
  file — dotenv never overrides an already-exported shell var.
- A clean `synth`/`build`/`plan` does NOT prove a deployed artifact runs — infrastructure-as-code
  only validates the spec, not the runtime. After deploying a scheduled or containerized job, run
  it ONCE in its real environment and check the actual effect (correct exit code AND the row/file
  it should produce), never just the synth. (Container gotcha: a `command` override on an image
  with a hardcoded `ENTRYPOINT` is often APPENDED as args rather than substituted — the spec looks
  right but the program never changes. To change what actually runs, override the entrypoint, not
  the command.)
- The real-environment run-once must check the **EXIT CODE**, not just that the row/file landed —
  a job can do its work correctly and STILL exit non-zero. (A native extension segfaulting during
  interpreter teardown — after the real work has already committed — is a classic case: the
  orchestrator sees exit≠0, marks a fully-successful job FAILED, and retry-loops forever. Neither
  `synth` nor a local run catches it; only the real-environment run does. **Fix for a one-shot
  CLI/array-job unit:** flush stdout/stderr and hard-exit with the intended code after the
  idempotent write has committed (e.g. `os._exit(code)` in `__main__`) to bypass the buggy
  teardown — never let a native-library finalization crash flip a committed job to FAILED.)

## /sprint status

Cross-project dashboard.

1. Read `~/.claude/sprint/projects.json`. Empty/missing → say so, point at `/sprint init`.
2. Per project: read `<ops>/STATE.md` — extract current-sprint pointer, status line,
   last-updated date, background-jobs table (if present, also check any referenced
   manifest/status files for staleness: `updated_at` older than expected cadence = flag),
   and open items. Unreadable path → report it as broken registration, don't crash the dashboard.
3. Report a compact table: project | current sprint | status | background jobs (healthy/
   stalled/none) | last updated | top open item. Flag anything that needs human attention.

## Registry format (`~/.claude/sprint/projects.json`)

```json
{ "projects": [ { "name": "<short-name>", "path": "/abs/path/to/repo", "ops": "/abs/path/to/ops" } ] }
```
